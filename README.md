🛠️ Task: Write an MST Prim’s code to solve the following problem with the same input and print the output graph including nodes and edges.

#### ⚡ Problem 2️⃣: [Greedy] (20 grades)

Given a set of activities and their starting and finishing times, find the maximum number of activities that a person can perform, assuming only one activity can be performed at a time.

This problem is known as the **activity selection problem**, where you need to select the maximum number of non-conflicting activities to perform within a given time frame.

**📥 Input:**  
11  
{1, 4}, {3, 5}, {0, 6}, {5, 7}, {3, 8}, {5, 9}, {6, 10}, {8, 11}, {8, 12}, {2, 13}, {12, 14}  

**🖥️ Output:**  
4  
{1, 4}, {5, 7}, {8, 11}, {12, 14}  

#### 🚓 Problem 3️⃣: [Greedy] (20 grades)

You are given an array where each element is either 'P' (policeman) or 'T' (thief). Find the maximum number of thieves that the police can catch, adhering to these conditions:

1. Each policeman can catch only one thief.
2. A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than `K` units away.

**Example 1:**

**📥 Input:**  
N = 5, K = 1  
arr[] = {P, T, T, P, T}

**🖥️ Output:**  
2

**📝 Explanation:** The first policeman catches the first thief, and the second policeman can catch either the second or third thief.

**Example 2:**

**📥 Input:**  
N = 6, K = 2  
arr[] = {T, T, P, P, T, P}

**🖥️ Output:**  
3

**📝 Explanation:** A maximum of 3 thieves can be caught.

#### 🔄 Problem 4️⃣: [Dynamic Programming] (30 grades)

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring using dynamic programming.

**Note:** A string is called a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the original string. For example, "radar" and "level" are palindromes.

**Example 1:**

**📥 Input:**  
s = "cbbd"

**🖥️ Output:**  
"bb"
