## Assignment #3

Cairo University  
Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence  
Algorithms Analysis and Design Course (Spring 2024)

### Guidelines

- You should submit the assignment in a group of a maximum of 4 students.
- You must join the same team as assignment 2.
- The discussions of both assignments 2 and 3 will be held together.
- Submit a zip file (name this file with your id: STUDENT-ID.zip) with all files (codes) for each problem (name code file p1, p2, .. etc).

### Problems

#### Problem 1: [MST] (30 grades)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9123d626-9601-4ef4-93d1-0920081eaa9c)

Please write an MST Primâ€™s code to solve the following problem with the same input and print the output graph including nodes and vertices.

#### Problem 2: [Greedy] (20 grades)

Given a set of activities and the starting and finishing time of each activity, find the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

This problem is called the activity selection problem, which concerns the selection of non-conflicting activities to perform within a given time frame, given a set of activities each marked by a start and finish time.

**Input:**  
11  
{1, 4}, {3, 5}, {0, 6}, {5, 7}, {3, 8}, {5, 9}, {6, 10}, {8, 11}, {8, 12}, {2, 13}, {12, 14}  

**Output:**  
4  
{1, 4}, {5, 7}, {8, 11}, {12, 14}  

#### Problem 3: [Greedy] (20 grades)

Given an array of size n, each element contains either a 'P' for a policeman or a 'T' for a thief. Find the maximum number of thieves that the police can catch. Keep in mind the following conditions:

1. Each policeman can catch only one thief.
2. A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than K units away from him.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  
N = 5, K = 1  
arr[] = {P, T, T, P, T}

**Output:**  
2

**Explanation:** Maximum 2 thieves can be caught. The first policeman catches the first thief and the second policeman can catch either the second or third thief.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  
N = 6, K = 2  
arr[] = {T, T, P, P, T, P}

**Output:**  
3

**Explanation:** Maximum of 3 thieves can be caught.

#### Problem 4: [Dynamic Programming] (30 grades)

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s using dynamic programming.

Note: A string is called a palindrome if the reverse of that string is the same as the original string. For example, "radar" and "level".

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  
s = "cbbd"

**Output:**  
"bb"
